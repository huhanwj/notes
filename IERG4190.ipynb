    "#### Basic Information\n",
    "In the LZ77 approach, the dictionary is simply a portion of the previously encoded sequence. The encoder examines the input sequence through a sliding window.\n",
    "\n",
    "*See the graphical explanation on slide 5 in the lecture note.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Search buffer: contains a portion of the recently encoded sequence, with usually several thousand characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Look-ahead buffer: contains the next portion of the sequence to be encoded, with usually ten to one hundred characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "To encode the sequence in the look-ahead buffer, the encoder moves a search pointer back through the search buffer until it encounters a match to the first symbol in the look-ahead buffer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Offset: the distance of the pointer from the look-ahead buffer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Length-of-match: the number of consecutive symbols in the search buffer that match consecutive symbols in the look-ahead buffer, starting with the first symbol.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the longest match is found, the encoder encodes a triple:\n",
    "\n",
    "<the offset, the length of match, the symbol following the match>\n",

    "Very simple adaptive scheme that requires no any prior knowledge of the source. The dictionary is the search window.\n",
    "\n",
    "Problems with LZ77:\n",
    "* The algorithm uses only a small window into previously seen text, which means it continuously throws away valuable phrases because they slide out of the dictionary.\n",
    "* The limited lengths of the two buffers limit the size of a phrase that can be matched.\n",
    "* Worst case situation is that the sequence to be encoded is periodic with a period longer than the search buffer.\n",
